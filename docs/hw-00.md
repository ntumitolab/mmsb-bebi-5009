# Rules for programming homeworks

## Format for Coding assignments

We (TA and Prof.) currently accept code in

- Python (`*.py`)
- Julia (`*.jl`)
- Jupyter Notebooks (`*.ipynb`) with either Python or Julia code

Please also tell us about the runtime environment (e.g. Python/Julia version, and packages). Providing dependency files is encouraged (e.g. `requirements.txt` for pip / `environment.yml` for conda / `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` for Julia). **Reproducibility matters**.

## Uploading your assignments

- Please upload your assignments to the assignment section in NTU COOL (<https://cool.ntu.edu.tw/>).
- Please upload other parts (text, math expressions, figures) along with the code if needed. NTU COOL supports uploading multiple files at once so you don't have to archive them.
- Please make sure your files and links are valid (by downloading and open again). Broken ones will receive *no credit*.
- Contact TA by e-mail if you have technical problems. (cannot access NTU COOL, cannot upload assignments, etc.)

## Getting scores

You will receive full credit if and only if the **output is correct** and your code is **able to reproduce** it.

- Wrong numbers / figures due to slight bugs in the code = *partial credit*.
- No code or spaghetti code that TA/Prof. cannot reproduce  = *no credit*.
- Late HW = *no credit*. (However, if you really have difficulties finishing the HW by the due date, please contact us *beforehand*.)
